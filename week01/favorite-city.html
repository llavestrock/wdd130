    <h1>My Favorite City</h1>
    <img src="../images/sandpoint.jpg" alt="The City of Sandpoint">
    <p>My favorite city so far is actually my hometown, in Sandpoint. I find this little city up in north idaho
        has it all. From a large warm lake, to mountain hikes, and a skii resort less than 10 minutes away from my
        house. There is
        always something to do in Sandpoint, and if you love the outdoors, which I do, You'll never get bored of the
        scenic views
        of the city wherever you go. It's beautiful and a great place to live.
